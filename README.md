### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis Project.

### Description
This project is part of the Udacity training courses that focus on Python and Git training. The analysis code is bikeshare.py and it will process the bikeshare data for one of three cities - Chicago, New York City or Washington.  The code and other associated files will be under version control via Git and GitHub. 

### Limitations 
As it is currently presented, the bikeshare code will offer the user options regarding which city data they want to analyze and if they want the data filtered by month and/or day of week.  The user MUST only select 'chicago' as the city for analysis because the test data files for the remaining two cities are not currently available.  If and when they are available then this restriction will no longer apply. (See below for file details.)

### Files used
The files included are:
- bikeshare.py : Python source code
- chicago.csv : Bikeshare test data for the city of Chicago.  
    Note: test data unavailable at this time for the remainihg two citiies.  If the extra test files are requied then they  should be named 'washington.csv' and 'newyourkcity.csv'.
- .gitignore : Excludes .csv test data file from remote repo updates.
- READEME.md : Project documentation file.
